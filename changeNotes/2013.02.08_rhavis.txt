Variants affected: CS, LS, and NE

Description: Height growth in the Region 9 variants is calculated using site
index curves and when tree height reaches the asmyptotic maxima of the curve
height growth is recuced to 0.1 foot per cycle. There was a problem where
the teh height increment calculated for the previous tree in teh tree list
was beeing added to the hight of trees having heights above the maximum
calculated by the site curve. This has been corrected.
